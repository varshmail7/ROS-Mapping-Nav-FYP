MSG: sensor_msgs/CameraInfo
# This message defines meta information for a camera. It should be in a
# camera namespace on topic \"camera_info\" and accompanied by up to five
# image topics named:
#
#   image_raw - raw data from the camera driver, possibly Bayer encoded
#   image            - monochrome, distorted
#   image_color      - color, distorted
#   image_rect       - monochrome, rectified
#   image_rect_color - color, rectified
#
# The image_pipeline contains packages (image_proc, stereo_image_proc)
# for producing the four processed image topics from image_raw and
# camera_info. The meaning of the camera parameters are described in
# detail at http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_pipeline/CameraInfo.
#
# The image_geometry package provides a user-friendly interface to
# common operations using this meta information. If you want to, e.g.,
# project a 3d point into image coordinates, we strongly recommend
# using image_geometry.
#
# If the camera is uncalibrated, the matrices D, K, R, P should be left
# zeroed out. In particular, clients may assume that K[0] == 0.0
# indicates an uncalibrated camera.

#  is the normal camera intrinsic matrix for the rectified image.
# It projects 3D points in the camera coordinate frame to 2D pixel
#  coordinates using the focal lengths (fx', fy') and principal point

# For monocular cameras, Tx = Ty = 0. Normally, monocular cameras will
#  also have R = the identity and P[1:3,1:3] = K.
# For a stereo pair, the fourth column [Tx Ty 0]' is related to the
#  position of the optical center of the second camera in the first
#  camera's frame. We assume Tz = 0 so both cameras are in the same

#  the right (second) camera of a horizontal stereo pair, Ty = 0 and
#  Tx = -fx' * B, where B is the baseline between the cameras.
# Given a 3D point [X Y Z]', the projection (x, y) of the point onto
#  the rectified image is given by:
#  [u v w]' = P * [X Y Z 1]'
#         x = u / w
#         y = v / w
